HomeConfigs
===========

An easy way to track and sync my configuration across multiple computers


TODO
====

install.py
----------

+ read what to install from commandline
+ make a backup of all files that will be overwritten
+ link all the files where a simple link is enough
+ copy all the files that need to be copied (a link is not enough)

### TO DECIDE:
Should I create a script for each single "config package" or only one big script?
